                        <br> Dear Industry Professionals:
                        <br> Welcome to my personal website! I am Justin Vo, a student at CART in the Web Applications Development, and this is the website created for my portfolio project. It is used to show my academic achievements I have accomplished in my CART class so far.
                        <br>
                        <br> Some academic strengths about me is that I am good at leading and good with computers. I am good with leading and giving direction because I normally have a vision of what I already want and can guide others to achieve it. I am also good with technology and know how to computer fundamentals such as Microsoft Office and Adobe softwares, and I also know how to code in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The information included in my website is a collection of all the work I have done at CART. It showcases my important assignments I have done this year in writing, coding, and art. I also have a page that includes my resume and 2 letters of recommendation. There is also a contact page where you can find my information and this introduction letter.
                        <br>
                        <br> So now enjoy the rest of the website and thank you for reading! I hope you like it!
                        <br>
                        <br> Sincerely,
                        <br> Justin Vo
