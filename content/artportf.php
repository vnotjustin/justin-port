                <p>This was a personal project of mine in which I created a wallpaper for my favorite eSports team using my knowledege of Photoshop. At the time, Team SoloMid had just qualified for a spot of 16 teams in the world for the League of Legends World Championships which boasted a 5 million dollar prize pool and over 20 different countries represented. To celebrate and commemorate their achievement and to test my recently developed photoshop techniques, I decided to put myself to the test and create my own background for my favorite team.</p>

                <p>This was a team photo I created for our posters we used for the CART olympics. The tech division decided that for our theme this year we wanted to do a Harambe themed rally. We wanted to pay tribute to this great ape we all cherished in our hearts. Using photoshop before I knew extensive techniques, I created a photoshopped Harambe photo and created a background of mice behind it because our rally had to somehow relate back to tech. Thus creating our term "Clicks our for Harambe." This was used from our whole branch for our mascot and tribute with us going on to eventually win the Spirit award in the CART olympics.</p>

                <p class="reviewp">This project was during the process us learning the tools of photoshop. We had an assignment where we were to learn and use all the layering tools to modify this "fruit smile" picture. We had to learn to use different layers such as brightness contrast, color balance, posterize, curves, channel mixer, and gradient fill. This lesson, while small, gave us the ability to make large leaps in our photoshop skills for future projects.</p>
