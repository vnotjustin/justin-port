                <p>We created autobiographys describing a personal event in our lives that has changed us for the better. Wanting to create one that wouldn't bore me writing nor the reader who was reading it, I decided to do it on a fun topic about my childhood fear of "Willy Wonka's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory". It was fun to write and assumingly it was probably fun reading about such an abnormal fear. It was interesting to go back and touch on a part of my childhood I had not visited for a long time.</p>

                <p>We created propaganda pieces for a revolution or revolt that has happened in history. I did mine on the recently controversial move of Britain leaving the European Union. It was fun to see what I was able to create that could be both popping and moving. These posters were created after a story we were started reading, "Animal Farm" which was about a communist movement personified through animals within a farm.</p>

                <p class="reviewp">For an English assignment for CART, we were to write a review for a piece of tech. I chose one of the games I had been waiting to get my hands on for over 2 years, Dishonored 2. In the review, I take a look at the quality of the story within the game, the feel of the gameplay, the uniqueness that sets it apart from other games, and I give an overview of what the feel and type of game it is. It was fun to write too because I was reviewing something I was passionate about, bringing a deeper connection to the review with myself.</p>
